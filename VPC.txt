NAT Gateway
A NAT gateway is an Amazon managed resource that is designed to operate just like a NAT
instance, but it is simpler to manage and highly available within an Availability Zone.

To allow instances within a private subnet to access Internet resources through the IGW via a
NAT gateway, you must do the following:
Configure the route table associated with the private subnet to direct Internet-bound
traffic to the NAT gateway (for example, nat-1a2b3c4d).
Allocate an EIP and associate it with the NAT gateway.
